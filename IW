Case Study
Russian Multi Domain Attacks to support ground attacks
WhisperGate, was designed to look like ransomware, The ransomware payload differs from a standard ransomware attack in several ways, indicating a solely destructive intent
HermeticWiper,
Viasat hack,rendered inoperable thousands of Viasat KA-SAT satellite broadband modems in Ukraine, including those used by military and other governmental agencies, causing major loss in internet communication

Day 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effects 
Physical --- economic damages 
information -- unknown how much (could have been to cover up more recon/attack)
congnitive -- panic on everyone who associates with ukraine

Purpose
to project the will of russia to the world and to try and isolate ukraine

mitigation
keeping computers updated - one non patched device compromised everyone else
higher priority on secuity -- it was approved to update but it wasnt high priority
what was done to contain - shut down as many computers/networks as possible but the malware moved to fast
in the us -- it would have been an act of war? so we dont even know

impact 
strategic impact is to put fear of russian cyber capabilities into ukraine/ the rest of the world

so what? 

in what way was cyberspace op used to complement other efforts -- ? commercial companies were working together to try to stop the malware, cyber works with io to make people react

emoe is a maneuver space a battle space a place where competition and warfare as well as commerce and other nonmilitary activties are conducted
the challenges of emoe complexity contested(detect disrupt exploit degrade deny decieve pr destroy) congested(mil/civilian ems dependent systems continue to crowd the spectrum) constrained ( domestic and international regulations cause the amount of spectrym available for military access to decrease[the rules and regulations for our  operations])

three major subdivisions of electromagnetic warfare -- electromagnetic attack, electromagnetic protection, electromagnetic support

EA -- Jamming(degrading disrupting or destroying communications/prevent or reduce enemy use of ems) Directed Energy Weapons (focused beam of em energy that can disable or destroy equipment personnel or facilities/infrared countermeasure systems designed to defeat rf and heat seeking armamnts) EM Pulse (produce damaging current and voltage surges -- disrupts or destroys electronic circutry) Deception( Designed to mislead enemy sensors by manipulation distortion or falsification of sensor data/convey misleading information to enemy em-dependent systems)
