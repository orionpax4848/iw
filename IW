Case Study
Russian Multi Domain Attacks to support ground attacks
WhisperGate, was designed to look like ransomware, The ransomware payload differs from a standard ransomware attack in several ways, indicating a solely destructive intent
HermeticWiper,
Viasat hack,rendered inoperable thousands of Viasat KA-SAT satellite broadband modems in Ukraine, including those used by military and other governmental agencies, causing major loss in internet communication

Day 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effects 
Physical --- economic damages 
information -- unknown how much (could have been to cover up more recon/attack)
congnitive -- panic on everyone who associates with ukraine

Purpose
to project the will of russia to the world and to try and isolate ukraine

mitigation
keeping computers updated - one non patched device compromised everyone else
higher priority on secuity -- it was approved to update but it wasnt high priority
what was done to contain - shut down as many computers/networks as possible but the malware moved to fast
in the us -- it would have been an act of war? so we dont even know

impact 
strategic impact is to put fear of russian cyber capabilities into ukraine/ the rest of the world

so what? 

in what way was cyberspace op used to complement other efforts -- ? commercial companies were working together to try to stop the malware, cyber works with io to make people react

emoe is a maneuver space a battle space a place where competition and warfare as well as commerce and other nonmilitary activties are conducted
the challenges of emoe complexity contested(detect disrupt exploit degrade deny decieve pr destroy) congested(mil/civilian ems dependent systems continue to crowd the spectrum) constrained ( domestic and international regulations cause the amount of spectrym available for military access to decrease[the rules and regulations for our  operations])

three major subdivisions of electromagnetic warfare -- electromagnetic attack, electromagnetic protection, electromagnetic support

EA -- Jamming(degrading disrupting or destroying communications/prevent or reduce enemy use of ems) Directed Energy Weapons (focused beam of em energy that can disable or destroy equipment personnel or facilities/infrared countermeasure systems designed to defeat rf and heat seeking armamnts) EM Pulse (produce damaging current and voltage surges -- disrupts or destroys electronic circutry) Deception( Designed to mislead enemy sensors by manipulation distortion or falsification of sensor data/convey misleading information to enemy em-dependent systems)
 
EP -- deminishes or eliminates negative impacts of electromagnetic interference from friendly neutral enemy o rnatrually occuring soutces

ES -- use es to visualize the battle field through the lens of the ems and shape the operational enviroment by detecting, intercepting, analyzing, identifying, locating and affecting( eny degrade disrupt deceive destroy and manipulate) adversary electomagnetic systems


Two models of the J-15D Roaring Shark spotted on board a Chinese aircraft carrier for the first time
 based on the J-15 Flying Shark – equipped with electronic countermeasure (ECM) pods on their wings were seen on the deck of the Shandong aircraft carrier 
 ith no powerful ammunition under its wings, the configuration of the J-10C is similar to the American F-16C/D Block 52 and Block 60 – a variant of the F-16 

 IW Balloons
 China’s FH-95 drone is designed to disrupt high-tech enemy networks and adds a new dimension to its drone warfare capabilities
 drones capable of electronic warfare, surveillance and early warning will become indispensable in combat
 FH-95 could provide electromagnetic interference to cover an attack by FH-97 stealth drones to penetrate and destroy air defenses, followed by an attack using more traditional FH-92A attack drones.



 space operations 
 gps
 unauthorized locations for inteligence
 link segment consists of signals connecting ground and space segments
 spcae segment involves the operational spaceraft wihin the space domain

 asat == antisatellite weapons ( russia used to use 7 orbits then explode) 
 physical network cognitive dimensions

CCDR's use CO to create effects in support of military obectives 
Cyberspace uses links and nodes located in the physical domain and perform logical functions to create effects first in cyberspace and then as needed in the physical domain

cyberspace operation comprise the military national and ordinary budiness operations of dod in and through cyberspace and are leverages in support of joint functions
effects are the results outcomes consequences of an action
